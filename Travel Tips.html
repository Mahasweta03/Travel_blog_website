       <h2>1. Count Your Dollars, But Don’t Pinch Your Pennies</h2> 
       <p>
        This is one of the most important tips for traveling we can give you. Don’t spend beyond your means when you decide to go traveling.
         You’ll regret every moment of your travels if you come back home from a trip of a lifetime only to face a mountain of debt.

       <h2>2. Always Get Travel Insurance</h2> 
       <p>This is seriously one of the best travel tips we can offer. Get travel insurance before you leave home. A lot of people say, “I only need travel insurance if I am going off the beaten path” but they are wrong. Accidents can happen anywhere.
        Ultimately, travel insurance doesn’t cost that much upfront but it can save so much in the long run. Better to travel safe than sorry.

       <h2>3.Hire Local Guides </h2> 
       <p> By hiring local guides, you are directly supporting the local economy. It cuts out the middle man and helps local families. Plus, hiring locals will help you save money. When you book tours overseas or online, you are paying the middle man, the tour operator, and the rent for an expensive office. When you book locally, the money is going directly into that person’s pocket. Plus, it’s a great way to make new friends and immerse in local culture.

       <h2>4. Respect Local Culture</h2> 
       <p>When visiting a new destination one of the best travel tips we can give is to learn about the culture and customs. Before you travel, do a bit of research to look into the way the culture dresses and what the accepted behavior is in public. You’ll feel more comfortable as you blend in and you save yourself some embarassement by doing something wrong.

       <p>Travel is your time to do something spontaneous that you’d never dream of doing at home. Whenever we’ve stepped out of our comfort zone, new and exciting things happened in our lives too. It just takes a small step to make a great change. Travel that can inspire you to take on new hobbies and see your life through different eyes. So go for it!

       <p>Travel costs a lot of money, so it’s good to have a plan before you fly. But don’t over plan. 
        Booking the perfect hotels, finding cheap flights, getting good deals, the budget, stamps in your passport, packing and repacking…it’s too much pressure if you let your travel plans take over.

       <p>Ask other tourists to take photos of yourself in front of those iconic sites around the world.  Get those epic shots and start making memories. And then print some of them out. Don’t just leave them on your phone or computer, make prints to display when you get back home to remind you of those amazing travel memories.

       <h2>8. A Smile Goes A Long Way </h2> 
       <p>A smile breaks the ice when you first meet people and it helps a lot in tough situations. Smiling can ease an uncomfortable moment and it breaks the tension with the people you meet along the way. When you get off off the beaten path, a smile is often the only thing you will have in common when communicating.

       <h2>9.Sunrise Is Better Than Sunset (Most Of The Time)</h2> 
       <p>Getting out early for sunrise is a chore, I know. But most of our best photographs and memorable quiet travel moments have happened at sunrise. When you go to an iconic view or landmark at sunset it is often overrun with tourists. But at sunrise, you usually have the place to yourself.  We love walking on the beach or through city streets while having it all to ourselves.</p>

       <h2>10. Don’t Be Afraid Of Street Food</h2> 
       <p>Don’t be afraid of eating street food. It is often the freshest and most authentic. Here’s a hot travel tip: If food is cooked over a flame, deep-fried or boiled, it is safe to eat. When looking for local food, we just walk around looking for vendors surrounded by locals. We avoid the overpriced tourist traps and instead join the regular patrons at their local hot spot.</p>

       <p>Before leaving to travel the world, go to a travel doctor or travel clinic to learn what vaccinations you need for each specific destination. Wearing breathable, long-sleeved clothing will protect you from insect bites. Insects hate light colours, so wear light coloured clothes. You can even buy insect repellent clothing to help reduce the risk of mosquito bites.

       <p>The best travel tip we can possibly give you is to pack light. We know what it’s like to overpack and it’s awful. We once carried dive gear through Central America and it ruined our travels. You don’t need a new outfit for every day of the week. You aren’t going to see the same people all the time and nobody is going to notice if you have the same T-shirt on as the other day. Pack lightweight clothing that is easy to wash.</p>

       <p>It’s always a good time to stand with a fellow traveler and look at a world map while on your trip.

        You get to share stories as you point out where you’ve visited. You can ask for signs, tips, and advice for future trips, depending on where the other person has been.  And you get to connect with someone on a level that is unique to travelers.</p>

    <p>Before leaving to travel the world, go to a travel doctor or travel clinic to learn what vaccinations you need for each specific destination. Do this at least 6 months in advance as some vaccinations require more than one shot. The doctor will also fill some travel-specific prescriptions like Malaria and antibiotics.

        Mosquitoes carry many diseases like Malaria and Zika. So just like we said above about covering up, wearing breathable, long-sleeved clothing will protect you from insect bites. Insects hate light colours, so wear light coloured clothes. You can even buy insect repellent clothing to help reduce the risk of mosquito bites.

    <p>It may seem easy, but this is one of those travel tips that people need to be reminded of. A photo is nice to have, but it’s how you feel in the moment that you will remember forever. Today’s world is noisy. Travel gives you the opportunity to block out the noise, so put down your smartphone and be present instead. When Dave and I look back on the past 20 years, we don’t remember how many likes a photo got on Instagram or how many views on TikTok, we remember the experiences we had.
