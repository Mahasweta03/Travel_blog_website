        <img src="prague1.jpg" alt="blog">
        <p><span class="text">"P</span>rague is one of Europe’s most popular cities. Owing to its stunning medieval architecture, it has developed a reputation as one of the continent’s must-see destinations.

          Unfortunately, its popularity means it gets packed during the summer. In 2019, nearly seven million tourists descended on Prague, a city of just 1.3 million people!!!! And the crowds have now returned post-COVID.
          But, while Prague may be battling overtourism, the city has a lot to offer intrepid (and repeat) visitors who want to see something other than the same old highlights.

          For example, did you know that about a hundred years ago, a group of Czech architects decided to apply Picasso’s Cubist style to architecture and that scattered around Prague is a small handful of Cubist buildings, including a Cubist café?

          Or that there are constantly revolving, doorless elevators in Prague that you have to hop in and out of?

          To help you deepen your visit and get off the beaten path, here is my list of the best unique things to do in Prague to help you see something different:"</p>
      </div>
    </div>   
    <div style="position:relative;">
      <h2>1. St. Jacob the Greater Church</h2>
      <div style="color: #ddd;
      background-color: #282E34;
      padding: 50px 80px;
      text-align: justify;
      display: flex;">
        <img src="prague2.jpeg" alt="blog">
        <p><span class="text">"T</span>he Church of St. Jacob the Greater gets overlooked because it sits in the shadow of Týn Cathedral on Old Town Square. But, for the curious who do venture inside this 13th-century basilica, if you look up just inside the entrance, you’ll see an object hanging from a chain.

          It’s a withered hand on a meat hook.
          
          As the story goes, a thief tried to steal some priceless jewels from a statue of the Virgin Mary at the altar. As he laid his hand on the jewels, the statue reached out and grabbed him. And it would not let go."</p>
      </div>
    </div>   
    <div style="position:relative;">
      <h2>2. Charles Square</h2>
      <div style="color: #ddd;
      background-color: #282E34;
      padding: 50px 80px;
      text-align: justify;
      display: flex;">
        <img src="prague3.jpeg" alt="blog">
        <p><span class="text">"O</span>ne of the largest squares in Europe, Charles Square sits in New Town (Nové Mesto). It was originally a cattle market where they also sold fish, wheat, and charcoal. And, for one week a year, Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, who made Prague the capital of the empire during his 14th-century reign, held an annual relics show here (relics were religious objects of important significance). Now, it’s a beautiful square few people visit but is a great place to people-watch."</p>
      </div>
    </div>   
    <div style="position:relative;">
      <h2>3. Bethlehem Chapel</h2>
      <div style="color: #ddd;
      background-color: #282E34;
      padding: 50px 80px;
      text-align: justify;

        <img src="prague4.jpeg" alt="blog">
        <p><span class="text">"L</span>ocated on a pleasant and intimate square in Old Town (Staré Mesto), this was where a man named Jan Hus preached to parishioners in the early 15th century — in Czech, not in Latin as was required at the time. This was considered radical. Hus was one of the most charismatic preachers in Prague. He attacked the pomp and circumstance of the church and papacy, which he said was designed to exclude commoners.
          Be sure to note the simplicity and lack of icons. The architecture was very much in line with Hus’s philosophy of how one should worship God."</p>
      </div>

    <div style="position:relative;">
      <h2>4. Vítkov Hill</h2>
      <div style="color: #ddd;

        <img src="prague5.jpg" alt="blog">
        <p><span class="text">"H</span>ike up to this hill east of Old Town and you’ll be rewarded with an excellent view. But there’s another reason to visit: it’s crowned by the world’s largest equestrian statue. The man on the horse is one-eyed General Jan Žižka. After the pope had Jan Hus (mentioned above) burned at the stake in 1415, people like Žižka took up his cause. He formed an army, and soon enough,
           warrior-crusaders representing the Pope were marching into Bohemia (the western half of today’s Czech Republic) to try to quash his reform-minded rebellion. About a thousand of Žižka’s men defeated an army of Catholic crusaders — some say there were 20,000 of them. The Hussites, as they called themselves, were eventually defeated by the Catholics, but Žižka’s spirit remains on Vítkov Hill.
           Prague is second only to New Orleans in having the highest number of pubs per capita, and Žižkov has about 300 of them, the highest density in Prague."</p>

      <h2>5. Infant of Prague</h2>
      <div style="color: #ddd;

        <img src="prague6.jpg" alt="blog">
        <p><span class="text">"I</span>f you’re a fan of religious history, one religious oddity worth seeking out in Prague is a baby doll on display inside the 16th-century Church of Our Lady Victorious in the Malá Strana neighborhood. The Infant of Prague (often referred to in Italian as Il Bambino di Praga) was brought to the city by King Ferdinand in 1628.
          Rampaging Swedish soldiers — who went on a wild frenzy in Prague in the 1630s — threw the doll in a pile of trash and it was lost. That is, until seven years later, when a priest was milling about the mountain of trash and heard a voice saying, “Psst. Psst. Have pity on me, and I will have pity on you. The more you honor me, the more I will bless you.” Ever since, the Infant has been back in its chapel in Our Lady Victorious.

        Today there is a cult of worship of the Infant of Prague in Catholic communities all over the world. In Ireland, for example, it is particularly auspicious for a soon-to-be bride to be given a miniature replica of the doll."</p>

        <pre><span class="text">"N</span>icknamed “the Elevator of Death,” the Paternoster is a type of lift that doesn’t have a door — and it doesn’t stop at floors. There are a handful of them around town but the one that is most easily accessible is in Prague City Hall in Old Town.

          Head through the front doors and walk the long hallway to the back of the building. There you’ll find the slow-moving lift. Jump in (carefully) and enjoy the ride. If you don’t get off on the top floors, have no fear: the elevator simply revolves in a loop, and soon enough you’ll be going back down.

They were awestruck by the new Eiffel Tower so the inspired Czechs went back home and raised enough money to erect a similar tower on Petrín Hill, near the center of Prague.
          Petrín Tower isn’t exactly a replica of the Eiffel Tower, but you can easily recognize that the tower was heavily inspired by the Eiffel Tower. Visitors today can trudge up the 299 stairs to get a stunning view of Prague."</p>

You’ll also visit a steampunk underground club, explore hidden cafes, see secret community theaters, and even learn about an underground crypto-anarchist hacker institute!

        <p><span class="text">"B</span>etween 1911 and 1914, a small group of Czech architects decided to see what it would be like if they applied Cubism — usually found in paintings, such as in the early-20th-century work of Picasso — to architecture. And so up went a few buildings that are beautiful, odd, and striking. You can stroll around the Vyšehrad neighborhood, about two miles south of Old Town, and find some of these structures.
          One other centrally located Cubist site you should seek out is on Jungmannovo námestí (Jungmann Square), just off the bottom of Václavské námestí (Wenceslas Square). It’s not only the most beautiful Cubist lamppost in the world — it’s the only Cubist lamppost in the world."</p>

        <p><span class="text">"O</span>n October 28, 1941, two Czech paratroopers who had been living in exile in Great Britain covertly parachuted into Prague under the cover of night. Their goal was to assassinate top Nazi official and head of the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia Reinhard Heydrich. The secret mission was called Operation Anthropoid.

          On May 27, 1942, Jozef Gabcik and Jan Kubiš ambushed Heydrich’s car, spraying Heydrich with a shower of bullets. Heydrich died a few days later, the only top Nazi official to be assassinated.
          After that, the Nazis wanted vengeance, so they went on a manhunt around Prague. The paratroopers went into hiding in the crypt of the medieval-era Cathedral of St. Cyril and Methodius for three weeks. Unfortunately, someone snitched on them, and soon enough, the Germans had the church surrounded. But once they finally broke into the crypt, they found Gabcik and Kubiš dead from self-inflicted bullet wounds."</p>

        <p><span class="text">"I</span>f you’re crossing the Charles Bridge and look to the north up the Vltava River toward Letná Park, you can see a giant metronome. As odd as it is, it’s not as weird as some of the other things that have been in that spot. For example, in 1955, Communist authorities erected the world’s largest statue of Josef Stalin.
          Stalin fell out of favor a few years later, and in 1962 the monument was blown up. In 1991, Prague erected the 75-foot functioning metronome in the same place. Its designer, Czech sculptor Vratislav Karel Novák, envisioned the monument as representing “the relentless passing of time.” A plaque at the base of the structure reads, “In time, all things pass.”
          If you visit the metronome in the warm-weather months today, there’s an outdoor bar selling beer and cocktails, sometimes a DJ is spinning tunes, and there is always a gaggle of skaters hanging around."</p>

There are also a handful of historic lodges and other buildings here too, some that date to the Middle Ages.
          Just one hour away from Prague by car, day trippers can visit the park to take in the beautiful landscape, hike, see local folk villages, and enjoy the scenery away from the crowds of the city.
          Tours from Prague generally last 8 hours and include visits to local artisan shops as well as lunch in a small local restaurant in the park."</p>

          It wasn’t until Prague allowed well-known Czech artist David Cerny to install ten giant crawling black babies on the shaft of the structure that public opinion began to soften a bit. It’s worth getting an up-close look at it. You can also get a great vista of Prague if you take the elevator up to the viewing platform.

That means that there are a plethora of (great) Vietnamese restaurants in Prague.

          If you want to dive in, the best place is called Sapa, also known as “Little Hanoi.” Even Anthony Bourdain made a point to visit this large market complex when he filmed a TV episode in Prague. It has a lot of cheap goods for sale, but the real reason to come here is to eat at one of the excellent northern Vietnamese restaurants.

But Czech artist Jaroslava Rona did something more creative with his entry: he had Kafka sitting on the shoulders of a headless man wearing a suit, an allusion to his short story “Description of a Struggle.”"</p>
